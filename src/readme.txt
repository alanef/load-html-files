Effortlessly load HTML files from a folder into posts with our WordPress plugin. Simplify your workflow and enhance your site's presentation today.

== Description ==

Introducing an early version of our plugin that allows you to easily integrate static HTML files into your WordPress site. We're excited to bring you this tool and we're open to your input for future features.

Our plugin is designed to take HTML files from a specified folder and load them into a post, simplifying your workflow. It automatically creates a category structure based on the folder/sub-folder structure, ensuring seamless organization.

We understand the importance of efficiency and ease of use, which is why we've included a feature that utilizes the first H1 tag in the file as the post title, removing it from the content. Additionally, all tags are removed from the file to ensure a clean and professional presentation.

While our plugin was originally developed to load HTML files generated by [Sailwave](https://www.sailwave.com/), we're thrilled to announce that it can be used to load any HTML file into a post. We're eager to hear your thoughts on what additional features you'd like to see included in future versions. Get in touch with us today and let us know how we can make this plugin work even better for you!
