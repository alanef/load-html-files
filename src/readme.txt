Effortlessly load HTML files from a folder into posts with our WordPress plugin. Simplify your workflow and enhance your site's presentation today.

== Description ==

The integration of static HTML files into a WordPress site has always been a time-consuming and complicated task. Our team recognized this issue and developed a plugin that simplifies the process. With our plugin, you no longer have to copy and paste HTML code into the WordPress editor or create custom page templates for each file. Instead, you can effortlessly load your HTML files into your WordPress site with just a few clicks.

One of the significant advantages of our plugin is the automatic categorization feature. It organizes your HTML files into categories and subcategories based on the folder structure, which makes it easy for visitors to navigate through your content. This feature saves you time and effort by eliminating the need to manually categorize each post.

Our plugin also eliminates the need to manually add titles and descriptions to each post. With the automatic H1 tag feature, the first H1 tag in the HTML file is used as the post title, making it easier for you to create engaging titles that attract visitors. The plugin also removes all tags from the file, ensuring that your content is clean and professional.

In addition to its user-friendly features, our plugin is also highly versatile. It was initially designed to work with Sailwave-generated HTML files, but we quickly realized that it could be used with any HTML file. This versatility makes it ideal for web developers, bloggers, and content creators who work with HTML files regularly.

We believe that this plugin has the potential to transform the way WordPress users handle static HTML files. We are continuously working to improve the plugin's functionality and add new features to make it even more useful. We welcome your feedback and suggestions on how we can make this tool better and easier to use.

In conclusion, our plugin provides a simple and efficient way to integrate static HTML files into your WordPress site. It eliminates the need for manual categorization, title and description creation, and tag removal, making the process much more streamlined. We are confident that this tool will save you time and effort while also enhancing the overall user experience for your visitors.
