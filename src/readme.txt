Auto load HTML files from a folder into a post.

== Description ==

This plugin takes HTML files from a folder and loads them into a post. It is useful for loading static HTML files into a WordPress site.
If the file is in a folder / sub folder this is used to create a category structure.

The first H1 tag in the file is used as the post title.

The post content is the <body> of the file with the H1 tag removed.

<script> tags are removed from the file. <style> tags are removed from the file.

This plugin was built to load HTML files generated by [Sailwave](https://www.sailwave.com/) into a WordPress site. Sailwave is a popular sailing results program.
However, it can be used to load any HTML file into a post.
